\section{Scope and Limitations}
This section identifies what part of the envisioned solution is going to be
developed in this current project or version, what will be delayed until
later projects, and what is out of scope for the whole product.  

\subsection{Scope of Initial Release}
The initial release of this program will read in a bill of materials for a set of wiring harnesses and trace the wires present.
The list of wires will be output in a table containing information about the wire, and possibly indicating error conditions.

\subsection{Scope of Subsequent Releases}
Subsequent additions to this program may allow wire lengths to be read in by image recognition software, and may check
for more complex error conditions.

\subsection{Limitations and Exclusions}
This program will not be able to design, edit, or visually display wiring harness schematics.

\section{Vision of the Solution}
\subsection{Vision Statement}
    PACCAR provides completely customizable trucks to their clients. However, with trucks and electronics becoming increasingly more complex, organizing all connections from wire to wire becomes increasingly difficult. Our team will create software that will read each start and end point for each wire for a truck, orgnaize and sort data by the wire, and validate the schematics will work against certain errors or oversights.  

\subsection{Major Features}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Read documents of a certain format and parse all wiring information needed.
    \item Export a document (PDF or excel spreadsheet) that organizes data by the wire showing all wire details and the start and end point.
    \item Create a simple graphical user interface that will allow the user to search and upload files as well as give status updates.
    \item The program will examine the current going through various wire gauges and will determine if any wire may pose a risk of overheating.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Assumptions and Dependencies}  
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Input will come in the form of Microsoft Excel Sheets. Column names and number of columns may slightly vary. 
    \item Output needs to be well organized to be readable by human eyes. 
    \item Program must be open to extension to test wire reports for different possible failures.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Features}

\subsection{Read/write from CSV and XLS}
\subsubsection{Description}
The software shall read from and write to .csv and .xlsx documents

\subsubsection{Priority}
High 

\subsubsection{Stimulus and Response}
 A user selects the documents from their hard drive through the file picker. The software will read the documents and write the results to a separate file

\subsubsection{Functional Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}


 
\item  The software shall read data from the selected .xlsx documents when selected
 and write output data to an .xlsx document upon completion.

 \item The software shall read from .xlsx documents the columns "From Component: Name" "From Component: Label", "To Component" "To Pin/Cavity" "Wire CSA"

 \item The software shall read from .csv documents the columns "Connector" "Pin", "Fuse Rating". for feature 3.3.

 \item The software shall write to .xlsx documents the columns "Circuit Label" "End Pin", "Start Pin" "Lowest Wire CSA", "Fuse Rating"
 \end{enumerate}
 
 \subsection{Splice Handling}
\subsubsection{Description}
 The software shall output a separate row in the spreadsheet for each output of a splice
\subsubsection{Priority}
High

\subsubsection{Stimulus and Response}
When a spliced wire is detected in the input, the software shall show each output of the splice in a separate row in the output Excel document.

\subsubsection{Functional Requirements}
 The software shall display a separate row of output for each output of a wire splice
 
  \subsection{Output Columns}
\subsubsection{Description}
The software shall output the following information for each wire:
Start Pin, End Pin, Fuse Rating. Wire Size, Circuit Function.
\subsubsection{Priority}
High

\subsubsection{Stimulus and Response}
The software reads this information from the inputted documents and compiles the information about each wire into an output document  as specified in requirement 3.3

\subsubsection{Functional Requirements}
 The software shall compile the above information into one Excel output document. Each wire connection will be a separate row in the document.
 
\subsection{Build to Windows}
\subsubsection{Description}
 The software will build to and run on a Windows 10 PC
\subsubsection{Priority}
High
\subsubsection{Stimulus and Response}
The software is operational on the Windows 10 operating system
\subsubsection{Functional Requirements}
The software shall be installable upon, and run on a Windows P.C running Windows 10.

  \subsection{Graphical User Interface}
\subsubsection{Description}
 The software will display a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that allows users to pick files, modify parameters, and see status of processing.
\subsubsection{Priority}
Medium.

\subsubsection{Stimulus and Response}
The software responds to user input and displays data through a graphical interface.

\subsubsection{Functional Requirements}
The software shall display a GUI that allows users to pick the input files and output location, specify names of columns for input, and show processing status.
 
  \subsection{Minimum Wire CSA Check}
\subsubsection{Description}
 The software will read, determine, and output the minimum Cross Sectional Area (CSA) of a wire through its entire run in the wire harness.
\subsubsection{Priority}
Low (Phase 2).

\subsubsection{Stimulus and Response}
The Cross Sectional Area of a wire is specified in the input and tracked to the output.

\subsubsection{Functional Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}
 \item The software shall determine the minimum wire CSA from the start point to the end point of the wire.
 \item The software will record this information in a column of the output .xlsx document
\end{enumerate}





  \subsection{Wire Overheating Check}
\subsubsection{Description}
The system shall cross-check the fuse rating of the wire with the wire CSA to determine if it could overheat.

\subsubsection{Priority}
Low (Phase 2).

\subsubsection{Stimulus and Response}
Wire CSA and fuse rating are part of the input document(s). A percentage of the fuse rating threshold is specified. Wires are flagged in the output document with indication that they could be subject to overheat.

\subsubsection{Functional Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}


\item The software shall determine whether wires are subject to overheating determined by a user-supplied fuse rating threshold and minumum wire CSA.
\item The software shall read wire size information from a .csv file with columns "Ampere Range" and "Wire CSA"

\item The software shall add a column to the ouput .xlsx document labeled "Overheat" showing whether wire CSA is within range of the provided .csv for the maximum fuse amperage

\end{enumerate}
